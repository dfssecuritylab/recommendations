# DFS Security Assurance Framework

The DFS security assurance framework follows similar principles from the ISO/IEC 27000 family - Information Security Management Systems, Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) v3.2, Payment Applications Data Security Standards (PA-DSS), National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-53, Revision 4. Technical guidelines from the Centre for Internet Security (CIS controls Version 7), the Open Web Security Application Project (OWASP) commonly referred to as OWASP Top 10 and used these as benchmarks to identify controls that are particular to the digital financial services ecosystem.

This framework consists of the following components:

1. A security risk assessment based on ISO/IEC 27005 â€“Security techniques -Information security risk management.
2. Assessment of threats and vulnerabilities to the underlying infrastructure, DFS applications, services, network operations and third-party providers involved in the ecosystem for DFS delivery (Section 8).
3. Mitigation strategies based on the outcome of (2) above.

This framework identifies

i.       The various security threats to DFS assets in each of the security dimensions

ii.      The related vulnerabilities that can be exploited by these threats.

iii.     Security control measures that can be implemented by DFS stakeholders against the threats and vulnerabilities are proposed. The security control measure can fall in one or more of the eight Security Dimensions in ITU-T Recommendation X.805
