# Risk assessment methodology

In order to ensure a security model that is sustainable and continuously improves DFS security, this framework uses the Deming cycle, a four-step quality model divided into four phases: Plan, Do, Check and Act (PDCA). In the PDCA based implementation methodology, activities and outcomes that have to be achieved in each of the four phases are identified.

In the DFS ecosystem, multiple stakeholders are involved and the PDCA is designed with activities that assure overall end to end security of the DFS ecosystem, the diagram below shows the DFS security framework model based on PDCA.

Monitoring and review in the DFS environment may take different forms depending on the stakeholder for example the regulator reviewing the security controls set by the DFS provider to assure security for the DFS users or internal and external reviews of the DFS environment by auditors. Thus, the monitoring phase also deals with escalating ad reporting of the risks to the relevant stakeholders.&#x20;

Communicating with management during all phases of the risk management process ensures understanding and ownership of the roles and responsibilities which is key for establishing the context appropriately, adequate identification of risks, multi-stakeholder risk analysis and evaluation. The communication with management gives a platform for a broader consultation and process review with all the DFS stakeholders which helps to secure endorsement and support for the risk treatment plans based on relevant and accurate view of the risks within the ecosystem.

#### Scope <a href="#scope" id="scope"></a>

The DFS security assurance framework is applicable to stakeholders in the DFS ecosystem. It defines security controls to be adopted by DFS users, mobile network operators, providers including banks and other licensed non-bank financial institutions, who supply financial products and services through digital means; these controls can be applied to the assets such as the infrastructure, applications and devices that make digital financial services possible.

For the user, the framework focuses on the security controls for the devices like mobile handsets used to access digital financial services. The means and technology are usually provided by a mobile network operator that allows for communication between the user and the DFS provider, the framework focuses on what the communications network provider has to do to secure the ecosystem.

This framework also includes the controls that have to be deployed by the DFS provider who may be a financial institution like a bank or non-bank provider, in some cases the communications network provider is also the digital financial services provider.

#### Establishing a context <a href="#establishing-a-context" id="establishing-a-context"></a>

This is the initial step in the risk management process and the objective is for the stakeholder to gain an understanding the DFS operating environment. This involves identifying internal and external events that affect the ability to achieve end to end security, it is therefore important for the stakeholder to understand and assess the internal and external context within which digital financial services operate, this also helps frame the scope of the risk assessment.

In order to establish the internal context, the following must be formulated

a.       The Information Security Management System based on the ISO/IEC 27001 the normative documents must be considered or implemented.

b.      DFS stakeholder overall organization structure and how DFS fit into this structure of the organizations and its objectives.

c.       Political and social environment, this includes demographics like level of education of the population, mobile device uptake and level of smartphone penetration to the target population.

d.      Competing alternatives and complementing services to digital financial services.

e.       Emerging risks and their influence, both to the financial service and stakeholders.

The outcome of this phase is a recorded summary of all information gathered. The information will form input into the risk assessment process.

### 7.3       Security Assessment

The risk assessment helps stakeholders to get indicative measures of the current security level in the DFS ecosystem, the security risk assessment process includes identification, analysis and evaluation of risks. The DFS risk assessment should be conducted periodically and the results feedback to management.

The overview of the process flow is shown below.

**Risk Identification**

Risk identification is to determine what, how, where and why DFS vulnerabilities might be exploited, this involves identifying critical DFS assets, associated threats and vulnerabilities, probability of occurrence, weaknesses in existing controls, impact or consequences of threats and vulnerabilities once exploited. In the process of risk identification, the stakeholder should be cognizant of the internal and external considerations in section 7.2 above.

In risk identification DFS stakeholders should consider five critical actions:

i.       **Asset Identification:** This entails listing all assets in the DFS ecosystem and who is responsible for them, assets in DFS include, but not limited to the physical infrastructure, software applications, hardware, agent equipment, customer/agent/merchant devices used to access DFS services and the communication network devices. Identification enables the stakeholder to classify the DFS assets based the impact an incident to the asset will have to the DFS ecosystem, classification aims at categorizing assets based on the value and criticality to the DFS ecosystem.

ii.      **Vulnerability Identification:** a vulnerability is a weakness or flaw that enables a threat to attack an asset, these include, but are not limited to, weaknesses in the: physical layout, organization procedures, personnel, management, hardware, software, network etc. They may be exploited by a threat, which may cause harm or damage to the system. The vulnerabilities identified should be highlighted in the risk assessment alongside the threats that affect an asset.

iii.     **Threat identification:** A threat is a potential for a source to exploit (accidentally or intentionally) a specific vulnerability. Threats can to DFS assets can be natural e.g. earthquake and floods, human e.g. theft and fraud or technical e.g. malware or server failures. Once a threat is identified, all information assets should be analyzed to uncover any vulnerabilities present that can be exploited by the threat.

iv.     **Existing control identification:** a list of all existing and planned controls, their implementation and usage status.

v.      **Consequence identification:** The magnitude of damage that could be caused by an incidents or a threat successfully exploiting a vulnerability. This process identifies the assets that can be affected and severity of impact. The magnitude of damage to a DFS asset in most cases is higher than the simple replacement cost, they are various damage considerations which may be monetary, technical, human and regulatory.

### 7.5       Risk Analysis

Risk analysis helps to understand the overall likelihood and impact of the threat on asset, which are both important for decision making and prioritizing actions to address the most critical risks and significant risks (risks with the greatest impact). The output of the risk analysis is an updated risk register that includes the probability and impact ratings of each risk, Risk analysis may be done quantitatively or qualitatively, or a combination of both.

The following process should be outputs of the risk analysis phase

i.       Assessment of consequences; the business impact upon the organization that might result from possible or actual information security incidents should be assessed, taking into account the consequences of a breach of information security such as loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability of the assets. Amongst others, the security consequences to DFS can also be in terms of financial loss, image reputation, loss goodwill, regulatory bans and fines.

ii.      Assess the probability of occurrence of a potential threat that can exploit vulnerability and its impact if successful. The probability of occurrence should take into consideration the preventive, detective controls in place, their effectiveness, implementation and usage.

iii.     Define Inherent risk rating as a product of Probability and Impact. The purpose of the inherent risk rating is to assist management in prioritizing management actions to address the most significant risks.

iv.     Define residual risk by assessing the effectiveness of the controls that exist for treating the risk. The controls implemented should reduce the risks to an acceptable level based on the DFS stakeholders risk appetite.

### 7.6       Risk Evaluation

During the risk evaluation process, the DFS stakeholder will compare identified risks and evaluate them against predetermined risk criteria to help determine the risks net effect to the DFS ecosystem. It also involves determining the effectiveness of the existing controls; that is, analyzing the probability and impact of the risks after considering existing controls then estimating the residual risks, this process facilities prioritization and decision making relating to the risk treatment and implementation.

When performing a risk evaluation, the following should be considered:

i.       Determine the effectiveness of existing controls in place for each threat vulnerability combination for an asset class i.e. effectiveness of controls in place that would mitigate the threat vulnerability pairing

ii.      Determine the Risk Impact

iii.     Determine the Residual Risk Rating as product of Probability of occurrence and Impact
