## Threats to DFS using USSD, SMS, IVR, STK and NSDT <a href="#threats-to-dfs-using-ussd-sms-ivr-stk-and-nsdt" id="threats-to-dfs-using-ussd-sms-ivr-stk-and-nsdt"></a>

The diagram below summarises the threats of DFS applications based on USSD, SMS, IVR, STK and NSDT.

## Threats to DFS ecosystem based on apps and digital wallets&#x20;

Mobile payment applications/wallets enable digital financial services through applications installed on the mobile device, the nature of financial applications and channels used will depend on the device capabilities, for example Samsung pay and Apple pay only for Samsung devices and Apple devices, whereas Google Pay can be used on all android devices, mobile payment applications utilizing Quick Response codes like WeChat Pay and AliPay can be used by all smartphones with a camera.​

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="253">Element</th><th>Threats</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Mobile Payment application</td><td><p>• Reverse engineering the application source code</p><p>• Tampering with the mobile payment application</p><p>• Exploit of mobile payment application vulnerabilities</p><p>• Installation of rootkits/malware</p><p>• Mobile Operating System Access Permissions</p></td></tr><tr><td>Mobile Device</td><td><p>• Installation of rogue applications and malware</p><p>• Unauthorized access to lost or stolen mobile device</p><p>• Malware installation on the device</p></td></tr><tr><td>Merchant Threats</td><td><p>• OS malware: Attackers may upload POS malware on POS devices that could be used to remotely access and payment data.</p><p>• QR code compromise: QR codes have inherent threats because they are not easily readable by the human eye, attackers could easily replace a merchants QR code with nefarious codes that could be embedded with malicious content.

Digital payment applications communication between the device/application and the payment provider is mainly reliant on internet channel through Wi-Fi, 3G and 4G networks, and/or a payment can be effected to a merchant Point Of Sale device using Magnetic Secure Transmission, scanning a Quick Response code or Near Field Communication (NFC).The use of these channels presents other threats and elements (POS, Acquirers, Payment Network Providers, Card issuers, Mobile Payment providers). Based on these components, we identify the following threats to DFS ecosystem based on mobile applications and wallets (i.e. Android, iOS).Based on the stakeholders within the DFS ecosystem, we consider merchants, acquirers, payment service providers, and issuers to be third-party providers (we show these individual entities in the expanded figure of the DFS ecosystem in Annex 1). While we list the general threats that these entities face here, the specific mitigations for addressing the threats that they face are out of scope for this document. We recommend consulting the PCI-DSS and the Cyber Resilience Oversight Expectations for Financial Market Infrastructures report\[i] to read more about mitigations.\
