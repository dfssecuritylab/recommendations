# Assessment of DFS security vulnerabilities, threats and mitigation Measures

In order to systematically counter the threats and vulnerabilities to the DFS ecosystem described in the above sections, we suggest controls for each of the entities within the ecosystem based on the eight security dimensions aimed at achieving end-to-end security.

Because there are often commonalities in the threats faced by entities throughout the DFS ecosystem, for ease of discussion we first consider a standardized threat that we have identified, the entity affected by the general threat, and the vulnerabilities, risks, and suggested mitigations and controls that can be deployed by that particular entity. We place the vulnerabilities in the context of their impact on the ITU-T X.805 security dimensions (SD).

The diagram in Figure below shows how the security threats identified earlier in Figure 9, are mapped to the 119 security control measures outlined in the sections below (the section number of the report appears in parentheses indicating where the relevant control is discussed).
