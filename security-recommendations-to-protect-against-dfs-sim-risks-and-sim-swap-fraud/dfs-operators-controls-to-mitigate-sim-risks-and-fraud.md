# DFS operators controls to mitigate SIM risks and fraud

1. **Real time IMSI/ICCID detection**: DFS and Payment Service Providers should be able to detect real-time whenever a SIM card associated with DFS services is swapped or replaced. Further verification before authorizing any transaction or account changes with new SIM should be required.
2. **Real time device change detection:** Device authentication to improve endpoint security by tracking the IMEI's of the devices used to access financial services. In this way, an account that changes devices can be flagged by the DFS operator
3. **Encourage use of secure DFS access:** Avail the customers the option to opt-out of the USSD or STK channels for financial transactions, especially those that can access the DFS using an app.
